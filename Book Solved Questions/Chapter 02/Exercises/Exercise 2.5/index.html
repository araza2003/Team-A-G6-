        <h2>Exercise 2.5</h2>
        <p>I recommended that two spaces between sentences be produced by using an &amp;nbsp;
        reference followed by a space (Section 2.3.4). Why is this approach to producing two
        spaces between sentences better than either using a space followed by &amp;nbsp; or using
        two &amp;nbsp; references? (Hint: Think about how the sentences will appear as the browser
        window is resized.) Your answer should not only describe how the sentences might
        appear, but also explain why.</p>

        <h2>Answer</h2>
        <p>The recommended approach of using <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> followed by a regular space ensures proper text wrapping behavior as the browser window is resized. Here's why:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>&amp;nbsp; followed by a space:</strong> The non-breaking space ensures that the first word and the space stay together, while the second space allows natural wrapping if needed.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Space followed by &amp;nbsp;:</strong> The normal space allows wrapping, but if the &amp;nbsp; is at the end of a line, it might cause inconsistent spacing.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Two &amp;nbsp; references:</strong> This approach prevents line breaks between the sentences, forcing them to stay on the same line and potentially leading to poor text flow.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thus, using <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> followed by a space ensures both proper spacing and flexible text wrapping as the browser adjusts.</p>
